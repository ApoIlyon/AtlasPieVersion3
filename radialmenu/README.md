# Radial Menu Configurator (Tauri)

This project is a simple Tauri desktop application written in Rust with a Vite + TypeScript frontend. It renders a configurable radial menu and allows you to tweak the items and layout in real time. Menu settings are persisted using the Tauri backend so that they are restored on the next launch.

## Prerequisites

Before building or running the app make sure the following tooling is installed:

1. **Rust toolchain** (installs `cargo`) – <https://rustup.rs>
2. **Tauri CLI** – `cargo install tauri-cli`
3. **Node.js (>=18)** and **pnpm** (recommended) or npm/yarn – required for the Vite frontend build

After installing Node you can install pnpm with `npm install -g pnpm`.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the Tauri app in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build a production bundle
pnpm tauri build
```

The configuration file is stored in your operating system specific application configuration directory (for example `%APPDATA%/radial-menu-tauri/config.json` on Windows).

## Project structure

```text
radial-menu-tauri/
├── dist/              # Built static assets (generated by Vite)
├── src/               # Frontend sources (TypeScript + CSS)
├── src-tauri/         # Rust backend
├── package.json       # Frontend dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json      # TypeScript compiler options
└── vite.config.ts     # Vite configuration
```

## Customising the radial menu

- Add, remove, or reorder menu items via the UI controls on the right.
- Adjust the radius and spacing to fine tune the layout.
- Click **Save layout** to persist changes, **Reset** to return to defaults.

Enjoy building your own radial launcher!
